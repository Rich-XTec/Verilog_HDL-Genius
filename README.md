# Verilog_HDL-Genius
Project made for Cyclone III chipsets with Verilog language on Intel Quartus II 13.0sp1.
It was Simulated on ModelSim.

The Pin Planner was made for PIC16f484c6.

You can use the source code, src, for another chipset as well, you just need to redo the pin connections accordingly.
